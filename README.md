# StackOverflow classification

The aim of this project is to develop a method for identifying which questions on the Stack Overflow website should be closed. To solve this problem, we propose using deep learning and neural network models to identify good candidates for closing.

The basis of our work is an article from Levi Franklin titled "Predicting Closed Stack Overflow Questions" : http://cs224d.stanford.edu/reports/lefrankl.pdf
